## Why make games?
Lots of gamers are also developers
If you're a developer and a gamer you should definitely consider making a game

## How?
1. Pick a framework
	* Don't reinvent the wheel
	* Hundreds of frameworks available
	* Which one to choose? Not one to rule them all
	* Recommended: Phaser
		* Free, open source HTML5 framework
		* Simple and powerful
		* Increasingly popular

2. Make one game
	* Don't make a 'real' game
	* Instead, make a really tiny one
		* Too big won't work, which will be annoying 
	* Examples:
		* No: Mariao, Zelda, CoD
		* Yes: Pong, Space Invader, Breakout
 
3. Make more games!

## Q&A
Mostly desktop game development
Broswer targeting: No specific browser, phaser works great cross browser
Renderer in Phaser: Webgl
Haven't had problems with GC with simple games

## Why HTML5 games?
* Web tech finally good enough to build decent games
* New market: focuss on woman
* Large potential reach
* No store ref share
* No install required by users
* Possibly definitive cross-platform solution
 
## Concerns
* Developer's learning curve
	* Language
	* Engine
	* Tools
	* Debugging
* Peformance
	* Mem consumption
	* Rendering speed
* Device and browser fragmentation
* Security
	* Copyright / priating
	* Cheating
* Repeated downloads
	* No offline play (limited localstorage)
* ROI: production cotst?
	* Revenue?
	* Learning budget?
	* Support?

## The experiment
* Zingo.com
* Proven gameplay
* Medium complexity and performance reqs
* Not too heavy on the graphics workload
* Webgl and Canvas

## How to start
* What to do? Use existing engine?
* Quickly up and runnning
 
## Findings
* Perf below expectations
* Android Stock browser (< AppleWebKit/537)
	* 55% - 80% share
* Low quality version
* Scaling & rotation
* Battery life 
## Missing parts
* Asset configuration!
* Resolution classes (Media Queries)
* Performance classes (?)
* Min/max aspect ration & auto scale
* Auto rotate on mobeil devices
* Development time vs published build resource support

## Q&A with Jake
Amazing to have built own game engine, would'nt do it again though
Used to be some GC pauses in FF, nowadays its much better
Tried to use ASM.js but failed misarebly. Couldn't get it to work. Tried to write in asm.js directly

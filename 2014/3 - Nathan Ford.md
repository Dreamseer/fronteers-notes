Working on the web is approaching maturity

## Capability Maturity model
1. Initial (chaotic
2. Repeatable
3. Defined
4. Managed
5. Optimized (Should be focussing on this)

## Can we optimise HTML? 
HTML is generally the better choice

HTML = Pretty damn good already.

First version of HTML was supposed to be editable in the browser

* HTML was always intended to be generated by a machine
* HTML was intended for content
* HTML was intended for **everyone**

* Markup is **NOT CODE**
* Markup is **DESIGN**
* Markup is **EASY**
* Markup is **UNFORGIVING**

Is writing markup intrinsically rewarding?

A clearer mental model = faster adoption

## Current models
* Word processor
* Drawing boxes
 


## List model

### Efficiencies of the list model
* Semantics , and validation built in
* An interface for learning
* Smart defaults

## Design too
There already are lots of tools to help you with CSS design
* Flexbox
* Gradients
* Animation
 
### Less typing, more thinking
Blog more
Spend more time with workgroups

## Q&A with Jake
When things become too complicated it becomes a barrier for learning
Q:'Are we holding ourselves back by supporting legacy stuff?"
We hold ourselves back by not knowing where we came from.

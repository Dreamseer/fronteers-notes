# This is the web platform

When we're building an app today, we're still using technology from 3/4/5 years ago

**Web platform**
* what was
* what is
* what will be

## What will be
> AppCache was dead on arrival

> Offline is the first big step on building web apps

**ServiceWorker**: github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker

* Every app should have a lifecycle

* Every devleoper should have control over the app stack
	* Fetch
	* Push
	* Message
	* Install
	* Sync
	* Geofenceenter
 
* You should be able to build higher level API's on lower level primitives
	* Make your own AppCache
	* Syncronisation
	* Inter-app communication
	* Paralax scrolling.....
 
### The headless web
* Headless browsers
* Physical web
	* https://google.github.io/physical-web/
* Google now
* Inter-app communication
 

### What do you want the web platform to be?
* Document based 
* App based
 
## What was
* caniuse.com
	* It's the data: https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse/data.json
* iwanttouse.com
* We are stuck in a world of IE <= 8
* onmobile.iwanttouse.com
* We are in a world where mobile is king
	* It opens a new base line
	* We can't have two base lines
* Raise your prices for IE8
* People don't want to drop IE8 support, but have no problems not adding accessibility for screen readers
* Native android browser is not so great, and we'll have to wait until we can drop support
* We need a sound component model to build modern mobile apps

* Not mobile
* No Dsicovery
* Not interconnected
* Monolithic
* Authentication
* Slow and ugly
* White screens

* Everything is ephemeral
 
* The platform has a lot of features, just not the right ones

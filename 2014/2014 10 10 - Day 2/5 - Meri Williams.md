## Agile

### Pattern: Write down your team values
* Refactoring: not on the backlog
* Big nono: Seagull management style

### Pattern: Deliberate practice
* Motivation
* exert effort to improve
* Take into account your pre-existing knowledge
* Immediate informative feedback
* repeatedly permorm the same task or similar tasks

#### Models of deliberate practice
* Sports model - analogous to conditioning
* Chess model - what did the grand master do?
* Music Model - Chunking & mental rehearsal

> Is the work designed in a way that makes it effective deliberate practice?


> Pro tip: Remember to talk about whether you're holding to your team values in you retros

Do retrospectives reather than post mortems
for a post mortem, something has to die first

### Pattern: ???

### Pattern: Define "done" appropriately
* Feels awkward, but very important
 
### Anti pattern: ???
* we are professionals, dammit
* you wouldn't charge extra for testing, would you
* why make accessibility an extra option
 
### Bake good practices in
* Articulate team values
* Value inclusivity & accessibility
* arrange your work as deliberate prcatice
* do accessibility testing katas
* define done appropriately & inclusively
* remember skills take tie to become automatic

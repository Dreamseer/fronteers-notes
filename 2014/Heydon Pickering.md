# Getting nowhere with CSS best practices

* Ultimate prcedure === best practice
 Anything can *not* be best practice
Nobody knows what best practice is
Webdevelopment === people telling each other that they dont do best practice
User ds don't care about best practice

## Best practices
* Readablity
* Efficiency
* Maintainablility
 
Readability is not usefull for dev tools > It rewrites / points to line#

Whitespaces could break a build
But HTLM and css most likely won't

* Using ID selectors
* Concatenating classes
* Using a unit on a zero value
* Using !important
* Qualifying headings
 
font-family: Asshole Script > will not break...
"HTML is the interface 
CSS is just the branding"

✔ <nav>
✔ role="navigation"

## States
Classes only define appearance of the state
aria-selected > .is-tab-selected

* aria-busy
* aria-grabbed
* aria-invalid
* etc..
Can be used by
* [aria-invalid] 
* etc...
in css

Styling based on text
(Q: how to do this with multiple languages / dynamic texts)

BEM = Mad version of OOCSS

Social media stuff = Only there to slow up the page

Moving site content around is like ripping pages from a book and rearranging them
Once you start doing that theres no stopping it

The question "Should I do this?"doesnt get asked often enough

Not part of best practices:
**Tab key**
We pay expensive usability experts after the projects to click tab key for us

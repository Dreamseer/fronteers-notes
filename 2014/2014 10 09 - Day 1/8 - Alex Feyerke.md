# Offline First Better (Web) Apps
Hoodie

## How we work
Its basically science fiction
"Here's how we imagine real people behaving in the future"

* "We're not normal"
* Build for a mobile world
* Normality is imperfect
* Offline is a fact of normal life
* Treat the network as an enhancement
* Progressive enhancement vs graceful degradation
	* Progressive enhancement is clearly the way to go

## What needs to be offline
* The app and its assets
* The app's data

## Hoodie demo
"You don't only get offline for free, but also multi device sync"

## Offline problems
* Trust and reliability
* As a mobile app user I want to be sure that my data is actually available when i need it
* People are afraid they will lose their data/state when closing an app / when having no network connection
* Always-online architecture
* My data isn't with me
	* If you're lucky its on a CDN on the same content as you
* As a mobile app user, I want to have my personal data on my device at all times
* Apps require advance planning to be useful
* Smart, offline maps, wouldn't that be nice (also, a bit spooky)

## Offline first challenges
* Save vs. sync
* New interaction challenges
	* Where to place stuff after being online?
	* How to notify the user about saving locally
	
## Offline first advantages
* Performance
	* Zero Latency
* Robustness
	* Server down? I don't Care
* Better experiences
	* Save all the time
 
Do you need your users' data?

The web platform is amazing

Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will be written in JavaScript

There are still many technical challenges

We need more awareness that this is a thing

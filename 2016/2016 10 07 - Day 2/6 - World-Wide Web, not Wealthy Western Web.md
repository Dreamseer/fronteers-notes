## Make the Web better for‚Ä¶

- Developers
- Consumers
- Business owners
- The next 4 billion people

**Ask yourself: where will your next customers come from?**

- Asia has 4 billion people atm.
  - China 1.3 bn., 7.7% GDP growth
  - Myanmar 13.6% GDP growth
  - India 190 m. users now, 400 m. next year
- What do these nations have in common?
  - see themselves as global citizens
  - people come online on smartphones, Mobile-only
- Top domains USA: google, FB, YT, wikipedia (highend handsets)
-     "       Indonesia: FB, google, wordpress (lowend handsets)

## Make the Web work on lower-spec devices

- PWA
  - ‚Äúinstall‚Äù apps on home screen
  - icon
  - full screen, portrait, landscape
  - app lives on the Web
  - Native apps take up space (460 MB vs. 1 MB for typical apps)
    - Installation fails due to flaky networks
  - use a manifest JSON
  - [pwa.rocks](https://pwa.rocks/)
  - requitre no ap store
  - live on the server, no update required
  - work offline
- Service Worker :party:
  - push notifigation (don‚Äôt SPAM, yo!)
  - background sync
- Responsive images
  - makes site faster
  - saves 70% of bandwidth
- Networks Notworks
  - solution: proxy browsers (Opera Mini, Chrome, Opera Turbo and stuff)
  - Opera Mini
    - Works with Thor (server on Iceland), minimizes site to about 10%
    - New Adblocking: sites are 14% faster, 35% faster Facebook
	- 89% less data, 14% less battery
- Battery life matters

## Design considerations for the developing worlds

- color! (don't use red in Thailand, means death)
- don't use given + family name fields, just use a single name field
- JS-only APIs dont work on proxy browsers
- no CSS features which drain battery (animation, gradients, web fonts)
- icons: use SVG
- serve HTML instead of JS that serves HTML (ask Airbnb, it‚Äôs faster, who knew?)

Whoa. Watch video for more details on Asian and African development of Internet usage, lots of stats and stuff

# Progressive Enhancement and CSS

- bitsofco.de
- What is it?
  - 2003: Graceful degredation
    - Designer don't test more than a version back
	- Expensive to retrofit to new alternate devices
	- does not address different needs of different audiences
  - Progressive Enhancement
    - web design must mature
	- must accept development of the past years
	- goal of web design is not to dazzle, but to deliver information to widest audience
- What does that mean in practice?
  - semantic markup for all content
  - correct elements in correct order
  - content in plain text, most accessible, best for PE
  - enhanced layout by CSS
    - CSS = enhancement, not requirement
  - enhanced behavior by JS
    - JS = enhancement, not requirement
  - end-user prefs should be respected
    - do not use `user-scalable=no` and stuff
- Why important today?
  - many more browsers and versions
  - many more new technologies
  - many more people online, thus more different user needs
- The Web is still open!
- PE and JS
  - What can go wrong?
    - maybe not enabled (like in Opera Mini)
	- browser does not support certain features
  - JS should be an enhancement, key functionality should work w/o JS
  - load polyfills if needed
- What can go wrong with HTML?
  - if browser does not understand a new element, it sees DIVs
  - add ARIA roles like `role="main"`
- What about CSS?
  - if browser does not support a preoperty or value, nothing happens
  - no built-in fallbacks in CSS
- Start with sensible HTML
- M&Ms: core is HTML, everything else is extra layer
- take advantage of cascade
  - use legacy code first
  - i.e. vendor prefixes above unprefixed version
- go mobile first
  - `min-width` > `max-width`
  - sth. that looks good on mobile looks a lot more usable on desktop
- use Flexbox
  - designed to be a PE
  - use it on your production sites
- last resort: use different stylesheets
  - i.e. for old IE
  - example: BBC “cutting the mustard”
- use CSS feature queries
  - `@supports (property: value) { … }`
  - detects all or either of several features, too
  - `@supports not (property: value) { … }` works, too
  - support quite good (no IE, no Opera Mini)
- good example: `object-fit`
  - use feature queries
  - *and* use advantage of cascade
- 2016:
  - VR + watches in the game
  - new technologies (Angular 23 :-))
  - more people online with different hardware

Thus:
> Leave no one behind!

## QA

- How far back should you go with support for older devices and stuff?
  - difficult, different for everyone
  - Opera Mini used in some regions, different baseline
  - look at your audience
- Problem: Industry overlooks Opera Mini?
  - people should be more aware of their user base and browser usage
  - if you're lucky, use more advanced features
- PE = challenges for designers and developers, do designers have to take care of it?
  - designers have to take it into account
- What is the biz case for PE?
  - again it's about user base
  - if you use PE, it's a faster, better experience for everyone

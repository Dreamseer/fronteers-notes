> 2010: The Web is dead

WTF?

## Apps

- New apps do not touch the web
- App-only experiences
- Universal links on iOS
- Doorslams (Medium: very bad example)

## Advertising, tracking, ugh

- Acct. 54% of load
- People block ads, 21% on Mobile due to privacy concerns
  - But no advertising = monetisation issues
- 85 cents per dollar of ad go to FB/GOOG

## The Web now

> Centralized websites are the future. (@evan)

- 1995-2001: portals
- 2002-2013: search
- 2014+: platforms (Medium, Twitter, iOS, esp. Facebook)
- developing countries come online fast and mobile-only
  - Facebook primary app, it’s the Internet for those people
- Instant Articles, about 10x faster than trad. page loads
  - AMP, Apple News are competitors
- Canvas Ads on Facebook
- Shopping on Facebook
- Messaging platforms are ever getting more important
  - FB, Slack, Kik
  - these are the new browsers
  - also: bots get richer and more powerful (i.e. Kayak), are conversational wrappers for APIs

*But:*

- Shopping still works better on the Web
- WeChat itself uses the Web
- Flipkart took site down, 4% of users used app
- PWA ftw.

*Thus:*

> 2015: The Web isn’t dead after all

(Told you so…)

## The Future

### Physical Web

- Nearby notifications
  - Bus station with upcoming buses
- Rich local discovery
- Web Bluetooth
- WebVR, AR

### What is the Web like in 20 yrs?

- Are we still using browsers?
- The Web is a user experience (@dries)

### Notifications

- Web Notifications
- Rich experiences, why install app?

- The Web enhances native
  - Messenger Web Views, no browser needed

**From a Web of destinations to a Web of interactions and experiences**

### QA

* Performance is important (that’s why AMP etc. exist)

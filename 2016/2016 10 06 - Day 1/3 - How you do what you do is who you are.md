# How you do what you do is who you are

- Howdy!
- Designer + Developer = Maker
- using React to improve UX
  - images
  - forms / user input
- multiple services: phone/tablet/web app
- transition from Backbone to React
- Stack:
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - Webpack
  - Babel
  - Coffescript -> ES6 -> Typescript
  - Stylus + Nib + inline styles in components (test-wise)
  - CSS Modules
- React all the things: ~450 kB bundled code
- image preloading
  - Baseline JPG or 404 image = no great UX
  - use React for loading image, broken image, final image using JS Image API
  - transparent spacer images for loading and better UX =Y no jank
  - use data URI for spacers = no add. request
  - different aspect ratios = different spacers => embrace SVG in React
  - load images in specific orders, specifically important for Mobile
- fluid text inputs
  - i.e. for search inputs
  - works in apps, what about the web?
    - must resize dynamically
    - must allow text selection (and other UX defaults)
	- must use placeholders
	- must work with touch and mouse
	- must behave consistent (single line, text scroll behavior)
  - what about `contentEditable`?
    - allows linebreaks, allows pasted content with formatting = BOO!
  - `INPUT` vs. `SPAN`
    - combine these (like I did with `SELECT`/`OUTPUT` for weg.de, yay!)
	- `placeholder` in masks with high `z-index` which catches clicks and stuff
- form
  - floating labels (nice, but I like my solution more, https://jsbin.com/sesaco)
- different image sources
  - Redux store, graph store
  - handling S3 errors
  - @TODO: re-watch this part or re-use otherâ€™s notes :-(

## QA

- use HTTP/2 for requesting images?
  - MVP
  - those optimizations are realistically hard to prioritize in product roadmap
  - features > optimizations in roadmap
- React: any usage benefits?
  - easier maintaining
  - easier data flow support, better to test
  - does not solve problems specifically, but quicker

## FED at Shopify

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, gazillions of tools
- Chaos?
  - inconsistent or buggy UI
  - spaghetti code :spaghetti:
  - hard to maintain or iterate
  - not accessible/performant/responsive

### Building a craft

- Language styleguides
- Shared coding standards
- Consistency is key
- Create predictable code
- Use linters like ESLint etc.

### Code reviews

- Standards to make things easier
  - If hard to enforce, it might not be helpful
- Burning code down is no option
- Builds a culture of feedback and knowledge sharing
  - Embrace pair programming! :pray:

### Pattern libraries

- A way to pool efforts
- Starting point for new projects
- Make it possible to share code automatically
- Common stacks
- Responsive guidelines (breakpoints, grids etc.)
- Performance standards
- Language tooling
- Accessibility
- Shared helpers (i.e. typical keyboard codes)
- Shopify UI library
  - Reusable core patterns
  - Ask: What are actual patterns? How should it be built?
  - Components :arrow_right: modules
- Solve problems once
- More people can contribute
- More time on most impactful features

## Summary

- teach – build – review :repeat:
- Building a culture
- Leverage expectations, improve hiring
- Have more conversations :speech_balloon:
  - Team talks
  - Talk about standards, common problems, share work from in and out of the day
  - Talk to designers (UX workshop) and backend devs (teach FE concepts)
- Find and follow opportunities for impact
  - **Optimize not for beautiful code, optimize for impact**
  - What do you want to grow?

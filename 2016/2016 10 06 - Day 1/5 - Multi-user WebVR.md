Great VR app: **Tilt Brush**

## VR is great for …

- Education
- Marketing
- Construction / architecture
- Healthcare
- Design / arts

## VR silos are created

- Oculus + DRM = bad, but they fixed it, woohoo
- Many different kinds of hardware, many silos

## WebVR to the rescue

- Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, Samsung and more work on the spec
- VR Demo Time

## What do we need?

- WebRTC (peer.js)
- WebGL (three.js)
- WebVR (`navigator.getVRDisplays().then((displays) => { … })`)
- *Code Demo Time*

## How to use

- Experimental browser builds
- Gamepad API support
- No DOM just yet :-(
- Progressive Enhancement bc. different devices with different capabilities

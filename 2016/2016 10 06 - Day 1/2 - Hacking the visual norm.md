# Hacking the visual norm

=> Very artsy, see video + slides

> Combine, reuse, design, hack charts

- D3.js ftw
- Data visualization = network
- Chart: development of HR chart for Adyen
- Chart: 10 most popular girl names
  - Uses an additional mini chart to show more data and allow selection of a wider range of data
- Design with code
- Nadieh shows gread iterations
- Use clipping of main chart when using mini charts
- “Bat Plot”, nice design
- “data sketch|es”, great movie charts
  - LOTR chart, awesome!

## QA

- Can you design charts ahead of code?
  - You should plugin the actual data very early
  - Sketches on paper first, then design with actual data
- Is progressive enhancement an option?
  - Work: support for IE8, thus required
  - Personal: don't care :-D
